15 mins react questions
15 min backend questions
30 mins coding

React / js
- some React knowledge, still beginner
- good understanding of lifecycle methods. candidate was clearly reading from notes (did not make this a secret as they told me they were looking through their algorithms at one point)
- very basic knowledge in javascript, not recommended to place in javascript area.
- seemed to have knowledge of flux/redux, but was unaware of the immutability of the state object

Backend

- good knowldege in java
- good knowledge in python
- good knowledge of sql
- decent knowldege of java spring boot
- no knowldege in graphQL, elasticSearch
- good knowldege of rest api
- no exp in cloud servives(gcp, aws, azure)
- no actual backend exp in workplace, but their background and knowldege is a good foundation

Coding
- recursive binary question:
  - had trouble solving it given my exact criteria, but was able to solve it using an alternate method
  - i think they could not solve it my way becuase they were using notes, although they did have a very good understanding of how and why their algorithem worked

- largest contiguous sum:
  - did not initially indenitfy the difficult test cases(proposed algorithm was not going to work)
  - again i susupect it was solved by looking up the algorithm 
  - was able to solve it. despite looking it up, they were able to grasp it quickly and understand it well, and properly explain it back to me
  

overall impressed that both question were answered correctly within half an hour. (with very little help, but notes used)

potential: 4/5
experience: 2/5
character: 5/5

- seems to be a quick learner with good problem solving abilities.
desipte lack of experience, i would give a thumbs up.
